# Components Database

A minimal, celestial-themed React + Vite project that showcases a collection of reusable UI components, complete with animations, glowing effects, and responsive layouts.

Literally a **components database**, where you can browse and preview various UI elements such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, cards, modals, and more — all designed for modern web projects.
These codes will be updated frequently.
